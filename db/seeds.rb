Article.create( title: 'StuyHacks Hosts Its Fourth Hackathon', content: '<p>StuyHacks held its fourth hackathon, StuyHacks IV, on Saturday, May 27, and Sunday, May 28. The event provided an opportunity for 175 high-school students from the U.S. and Canada to learn about and to immerse themselves in computer science.</p>
<p>A hackathon is an event where programmers can collaborate on a range of computer science projects. The hackathon organizers secured the sponsorship of a number of technology companies, including Facebook, MakeSchool, RedSeal, and ThoughtWorks, to subsidize the event. The event was held in the Midtown office of ThoughtWorks.</p>
<p>StuyHacks worked together with the computer science department and the Dojo, which is an afterschool community for computer science enthusiasts, to recruit mentors to help teach at the hackathon. “Mentors [were] generally college students who are majoring in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Some mentors [were] also students from Stuyvesant who are currently taking post-AP level courses,” senior and StuyHacks logistics director Prangon Ghose said.</p>
<p>During the hackathon, attendees were organized into groups of two to four for a team-building session. These teams competed against one another as they worked on a variety of programming projects, from developing a mobile app to building a robot.</p>
<p>Alongside the competitions, multiple workshops were held throughout the event to teach attendees different computer science skills and languages. For example, junior Shakil Rafi led the Android Development workshop, which taught participants how to code apps for the Android operating system. </p>
<p>At the end of StuyHacks IV, a panel of judges evaluated the group projects and gave out multiple awards based off of them. Seniors Nicholas Ng, Anya Keller, Mikhail Kotlik, and Daniel Monteagudo came in third place for the best overall project award for their work on Politalk, a website inspired by the 2016 election that connects people with opposing political ideologies through a chat app.</p>
<p>For future hackathons, StuyHacks organizers hope to increase funding to expand the event by reserving a larger venue and adding more workshops. Despite this, StuyHacks IV was well received by many of its attendees. “Having been to past StuyHacks, it is amazing to see all the improvements done over the years to benefit programmers,” senior Kevin Zhang said.</p>

Article.create( title: 'Uncontested; Unelected?', content: '<p>An unopposed candidacy might signify incredible popularity, and a margin of victory of 100 percent. It could also signify a lack of opposition, and of civic engagement. In the worst case, the election may be coerced. James Monroe was elected President of the United States by a margin of 228-1 in 1820; Kim Jong-un was elected President of North Korea by a margin of 687-0 in 2014. From overwhelming approval to coercion, the most recent Student Union (SU) elections fall somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Bitter liberals like to whine about the low democratic turnout in America’s presidential election, but Stuyvesant is much worse, routinely seeing only a minority of the student body vote. This year, the SU and Senior Caucus elections stooped to a new level of apathy, each featuring a single candidacy. Junior Kevin Boodram, who ran for caucus three times in the past, said, “ I don’t think people understand what the Student Union does. I think that discourages a lot people from running in the first place, even voting.” His older brother’s friends told him the SU was only good for planning parties.</p>
<p>Yet the SU organizes perhaps the biggest display of school spirit each year, SING!. The SU’s impressive budget of over $100,000 is what makes clubs and publications possible. And the President and Vice President routinely meet with school administration as the ones advocating for the student body. Perhaps it is time to pay more attention to election season.</p>
<p>If presented with the opportunity to cast a ballot, I surely would have voted for Tahseen Chowdhury and Alexa Valentino for Student Union President and Vice President, as well as for Pallab Saha and Abie Rohrig for Senior Caucus; the problem, however, is that not a single ballot was cast. With the student body’s interests at stake, it is dangerous to have an uncontested—and therefore unelected—official in power (see North Korea).</p>
<p>A more troubling trend, however, seems to be damaging SU elections: the toxic environment surrounding challenges to the incumbent. Most recently, sophomore Abner Kahan faced personal attacks over Facebook for trying to run for positions in the Student Union. “Most people laughed at me and didn’t take me seriously. Some were even slightly hostile,” Kahan said. </p>
<p>Hostility directly discourages students from running. It is hard enough to break into the SU—incumbents have the advantage of knowing the organization’s inner-workings, evidenced by a six-year chain of SU Vice Presidents becoming President. Bullying is not only degrading, but makes the task impossible; Kahan gave up on running for Student Union, and eventually pulled out of the Junior Caucus race—his ideas were effectively silenced.</p>
<p>Boodram added that it is very difficult for candidates to run after suffering a loss. “If you lose a campaign, and you try to do anything after that, people are always going to flame you and say you’re salty or whatever and criticize you for trying to run again,” he said, nodding vigorously when asked if he was bullied. Stuyvesant students are quick to transgress the boundary from debating policies to personal attacks.</p>
<p>SU elections have always been meaningful; now it is time for the student body to treat them professionally. Innovation and competition are crucial to testing ideas and ensuring our Student Union provides us with the best experience they can, but this is only possible if we are open to new ideas and have the confidence that, when we choose to speak out, others will respect our voices.</p>

Article.create( title: 'The Rooftop Garden: What Does Urban Growth Really Mean?', content: '<p>Through the balcony doors in the woodshop class on the 10th floor lies the rooftop garden. A small, bright space with quaint wooden crates and a mishmash of colorful planting supplies, Stuyvesant’s rooftop garden delivers fresh veggies and a dose of relaxation that is inevitable when sunshine, plants, and a gorgeous view are involved.</p>
<p>When I went up to the rooftop garden, I was struck by what a welcome change the airy, carefree space was from the stress of Stuyvesant. Guided by biology teacher Marissa Maggio, my friends and I helped water the recently sprouted herbs and vegetables, soaking them with the long hose that we tugged around the garden and learning firsthand the importance of the rooftop garden in our urban landscape. </p>
<p>The rooftop garden was created by the Environmental Club, inspired by Battery Urban Farm, an education farm in Battery Park that aims to teach students about sustainable farming and get them involved in growing their own food. The rooftop garden was created to expand those values to Stuyvesant by using the space available in our school to compensate for the limited room on the Battery Urban Farm plot.</p>
<p>Though the rooftop garden has been around for awhile, explored by different clubs and different grades, this year, the Environmental Club focused on revamping the garden. Maggio reached out to senior Livia Kunins-Berkowitz, who had spent her spring semester of junior year living and working at the Mountain School, a farm-school in Vermont. </p>
<p>Kunins-Berkowitz, guided by her passion for gardening and agriculture, threw herself into the project. “I’m really into environmentalism, and as a city person, we’re so removed from food production,” she said. “If we’re going to be sustainable, we need to learn how to grow in urban spaces because our country is so urban now. I want there to be opportunities for kids get involved and find a passion and learn about something they would never have the opportunity to learn otherwise.”</p>
<p>Careful planning gave way to two planting sessions, with students eager to get involved. “I’m excited by how many people are interested in [the rooftop garden] and like different friend groups and all that kind of stuff.  It always makes me really happy when different people come together,” Kunins-Berkowitz said.</p>
<p>Now, as the plants are growing, Maggio contacts Kunins-Berkowitz with her free periods, and members sign up to water during those periods on the rooftop garden’s Facebook page and show up when they can. “It’s this nice, casual thing,” Kunins-Berkowitz said.</p>
<p>Club members were drawn to the rooftop garden because of the unique chance they get to practice gardening. “You can live in the city, and yet, you can do all these things that are garden-y and leisurely,” sophomore Sophia Atlas said. </p>
<p>Being on the roof is also a big selling point. “I mostly wanted to see what the roof looked like,” sophomore Louise Wagenseil admitted with a laugh. Her interest, though, stems from prior school efforts to help the environment. “[In elementary school], we actually grew our own vegetables for the cafeteria, and they were actually good vegetables, so I was kind of interested to see how Stuy[vesant] would do the same thing.” </p>
<p>It’s a lot of fun for members, plainly visible in the stories members recall with a laugh. “At one point, someone was holding the hose, and the hose has to go all the way from the wall of the woodworking room all the way outside, and the hose wasn’t really that long, and so a bunch of people were pulling the hose, and it exploded,” Wagenseil reminisced.</p>
<p>Whether students realize it or not, the rooftop garden has a heavy impact on all Stuyvesant students—it’s their lunch. Food harvested from the rooftop garden goes back into the salad bar in the cafeteria. </p>
<p>On a wider level, rooftop gardens not only provide fresh food, but they also improve air quality and lower increased temperatures in urban areas, known as urban heat island effect control. “The sustainable future of America is in learning how to grow in urban spaces,” Kunins-Benowitz said.</p>
<p>A huge chunk of America’s failing relationship with the environment is waste-related, and the hard work put into the garden helps members gain a deeper perception of this issue. The Guardian estimated roughly 50 percent of all produce in the United States is thrown away; this happens because it’s so easy for us to get everything that we take the availability of produce for granted. </p>
<p>By making the rooftop garden environment so personal, it offers a solution to this problem. “When you spend months taking care of this garden, you don’t wanna be throwing that out,” sophomore Secretary of the Environmental Club Kenny Wong said. </p>
Along with the tomatoes and kale, the rooftop garden delivers an empowering sense of independence and awareness. “We have so little power over what we eat, especially as kids, and it’s so cool to take control of your life in this way,” Kunins-Berkowitz said. </p>
<p>As New Yorkers and students, we are isolated from the origins and processes that go into the food we mindlessly consume, most of our knowledge coming from the inspiring stories on the back of cereal boxes. The rooftop garden is a rare opportunity to learn, and it is one that should be seized.</p>

Article.create( title: 'The Privilege of Peeing', content: '<p>The curtains of the Murray Kahn Theater opened to a grim color scheme of yellow and black, topped with a garbage green brick wall that read “Public Amenity #9,” the most disgusting urinal in town. The arrangement of set pieces was intentionally messy, setting a backdrop for the varying levels of chaos that would ensue for the duration of the show.</p>
<p>The Stuyvesant Theater Community (STC)’s 2017 spring musical comedy, “Urinetown,” can only be described as a brilliantly orchestrated disaster. From atrocious, mismatched outfits to the use of toilet paper as twirling ribbons, impeccable choices were made in all departments to capture the crooked, chaotic universe of “Urinetown.” The show, directed by seniors Enver Ramadani and Dennis Ronel and sophomore Kareena Singh, ran on May 31 and June 2-3, and made for one of the most impressive STC shows in a while.</p>
<p>“Urinetown” is set in a fictional town that has suffered from a 20-year drought, which has led to the privatization of all of the toilets in town. The toilets, or filthy public amenities, are controlled by the Urine Good Company (UGC), led by the villainous Caldwell B. Cladwell (sophomore Adam Elsayed). People do their business on a pay-to-pee basis, and if they don’t comply, they get exiled to a penal colony called Urinetown.</p>
<p>The cast is split between a ragtag team of poor, angry townspeople and the people in charge. The juxtaposition between the poor protagonists and the powerful antagonists is written as an extreme cliché, and the STC cast successfully conveyed the “heroes vs. villains” trope. However, as a show that routinely breaks the fourth wall and interacts with the audience in a sketch comedic manner, “Urinetown” is far from a mere cliché. Throughout the show, the lines between hero and villain are blurred through heartwarming and heart-wrenching plot twists followed by exaggerated ensemble reactions.</p>
<p>The intimidating, rule-enforcing Officer Lockstock (senior Leith Conybeare) opened the show with a spine-chilling monologue detailing the town’s unfortunate situation. Lockstock was soon joined by adorable, doe-eyed Little Sally (senior Nadia Filanovsky), who routinely made quips about hydraulics and remarks that broke the fourth wall, such as, “This isn’t a happy musical.” Little Sally was able to bring out the softer side of Officer Lockstock, and the heartwarming rapport between Coneybeare and Filanovsky was one of the highlights of the show.</p>
<p>The two shined onstage individually, as well. Coneybeare hit every comedic beat and nailed the many complex layers of Lockstock’s character. In “Too Much Exposition,” her gorgeous voice rang through the auditorium. Likewise, Filanovsky thoughtfully portrayed Little Sally’s character arc, leading up to a breathtaking performance for her grand solo in “Tell Her I Love Her,” where her powerful Broadway belt truly packed a punch.</p>
<p>Another standout performance was senior Jessica Sparacio’s Penelope Pennywise, the rigid, unforgiving woman who runs Public Amenity #9. Sparacio captured both the rough edges and the raw emotion of Pennywise with a mind-blowing attention to detail, from her aggressive physicality to the way she spat on every “p” in “It’s a Privilege to Pee.” Alongside Sparacio’s stellar acting were her unbelievable vocals. A bona fide mezzo belter, Sparacio hit the song’s high notes with ease.</p>
<p>However, these three were only several of the great performances in “Urinetown.” Elsayed’s portrayal of the malevolent Mr. Cladwell was hilarious and entertaining, and junior Travis Tyson’s rendition of Pennywise’s loveable, fresh-faced assistant Bobby Strong carried some of the show’s most emotional moments.</p>
<p>Even the smaller characters, who spent most of their time in the ensemble, stole the show for their small moments in the spotlight. Freshman Victoria Wong, as the poor, pregnant Little Becky Two-Shoes, hobbled around stage with an amazing presence. Senior Jenna Bawer was also a natural onstage as Hot Blades Harry, and her energy was a joy to watch.</p>
<p>While “Urinetown” boasted countless spectacular individual performances, the characters lacked cohesiveness as an ensemble. It often felt as if the actors were basking in the spotlight when they should have been reacting to each other, especially during moments of dialogue. As such, certain relationships that are pivotal to the “Urinetown” plot were underdeveloped, a particular example being the romantic relationship between Bobby Strong and Hope Cladwell (senior Lillian Carver). While both Tyson and Carver were evidently talented actors, they lacked chemistry as a couple.</p>
<p>For the most part, the show’s ensemble didn’t have this problem. However, some of the smaller characters singing alongside the ensemble were mic’d while the rest of the ensemble wasn’t, and this ruined the sound balance in several songs. “Urinetown,” like many musical comedies, is somewhat of an ensemble-driven show, and the wealth of energy and talent in the ensemble’s songs and dances is a large part of what made this such a successful production.</p>
<p>Another particularly impressive element of the show was the creativity and attention to detail in the use of props. From toilet plungers to toilet paper, many common household items were used for things other than their intended purposes.</p>
<p>The layout of papers and cash-filled suitcases on Mr. Cladwell’s desk perfectly brought about the atmosphere of a corporate office, and during the big protest at the end of Act One, the large, messily constructed picket sign reading “FREE THE PEEPL” encapsulated the unique humor of the show. The lighting, costume choices, and the insanely talented band were also artful and professional, contributing to the unparalleled immaculacy of this production.</p>
<p>The show closed with an uplifting, bluesy performance of “I See A River,” where Carver’s fluid vocals and warm timbre shined. The beautiful music was paired with a classic, corny epilogue narration of what happened to the characters after the story ended. The epilogue was delivered in a wonderfully cringy manner, reminding the audience that “Urinetown” is an emotional rollercoaster of pure satire—a difficult musical to nail, but one that, for the most part, STC successfully did.</p>

Article.create( title: 'The Pinnacle of Time Management', content: '<p>With the APs quickly approaching, many Stuyvesant students have their noses buried in test-prep books as if they were searching for a second-term senior’s commitment to school. Others completely replace studying with the time-honored tactic of not studying. Sophomore Andrew Werner, on the other hand, has brought his third-best idea—after his wildly successful Flag Rugby team and Satanic Ritual club—to fruition: a time machine. “This machine will revolutionize the way students study for history tests. We can watch history like we watch Netflix,” Werner said.</p>
<p>AP World History teacher Zachary Berman gave his thoughts on Werner’s creation: “While it’s a marvel of science, a time machine simply isn’t practical. History is long, and events like the Attack of the Clones require context and 30 shekels to fully understand. A better application of the time machine may be to actively change history so you can’t possibly get anything wrong on the AP test!” Berman proceeded to wear off his caffeine high by spinning around like a Sufi.</p>
<p>While altering the past seems tempting, telling yourself from the beginning of the semester to prepare a textbook-sized outline to cram the night before the test seems more practical. Anyway, the odds of riding along with Werner are slim since the whole sophomore class is clamoring for a seat like it’s an open computer at the printing station, so good luck!</p>

Article.create( title: 'Another Victorious Season for the Greyducks', content:'<p>With summer around the corner, the girls’ outdoor track team finished another stellar season. The Greyducks started the season with two goals: to become back-to-back Manhattan borough champions, and to finish on the podium at the City Championships. With a strong performance in the field events, the girls accomplished their first goal, coming in first place in the Manhattan Borough Championship on May 21. But despite stellar individual performances at City Championships a week later on May 28, the Greyducks came in seventh place and could not reach the podium.</p><p>While it is true that the Greyducks didn’t come in the top three, it is also important to note that the difference in points between places is minimal. For example, a seventh place and a fourth place finish are less than ten points apart, as Dr. Markova, the coach of the girls’ team pointed out. “The difference between fourth and seventh places were very small. The competition was very close and we could have been fourth or seventh.”</p><p>Starting from their first meet on March 25, the girls’ track team had a very successful season. Though it started out slow, it quickly picked up: they dominated the 1500-meter racewalk at the Bob Zifchak Classic Meet on April 30, and the Spring Series meets on March 29, April 19, and May 2, largely due to sophomores Kayla Lew, Bernice Chen, and Jeanette Cheung, freshman Tina Zheng, and junior Joyce Wu. With such a strong team, even without the graduating seniors, next year is looking bright.</p><p>At the Mayor’s Cup on April 8, senior and star athlete Zovinar Khrimian came in first place in the 1500 meter race (5:06.81). The sophomore 4×800-meter relay team, composed of Clara Mohri, Tiffany Zhong, Jocelyn Tang, and Vivian Cribb placed an outstanding second place in the sophomore division. In addition, the freshman 4×800-meter relay team, which consisted of Doris Chen, Tiffany Cao, Jing Su, and Ester Suleymanov, placed fourth in the freshman division.</p><p>At the Manhattan Borough Championship on May 21, the Greyducks dominated the field events. At the start of the season, senior and co-captain Lucia Liu had hoped to strengthen the Greyducks’ performance in field events—which ended up being one of the reasons that the team performed so well. For example, junior Daria Shifrina came in first in both the high jump and triple jump, with a height of four feet, six inches and a distance of 32-01.50, respectively. Shifrina also came in third in the long jump, with a distance of 14 feet and seven inches. The Greyducks also dominated the pole vault with outstanding individual performances, with Liu taking first place, junior Venus Nnadi coming in second, and freshman Zoe Zakrzewska coming in fourth.</p><p>Senior Zovinar Khrimian and sophomore Clara Mohri also did extremely well in the track events. Mohri came in first in the 3000-meter race and third in the 1500-meter race. Khrimian came in second in both the 3000-meter race and the 1500-meter race.</p><p>All of this led up to the City Championships event at Icahn Stadium on Randall’s Island on Sunday, May 28. In the field events, Nnadi and Liu tied for 7th place in the pole vault with seven and a half feet. In the relay events, the 4×800 team, consisting of senior Catriona Breen, Khrimian, Mohri, and Cribb, came in third place just behind the Staten Island Tech team—an incredible accomplishment for the Greyducks. Khrimian said, “Everyone was in good spirits, especially at the end when the 4×800 [meter relay team] came in third in the city.”</p><p>The Greyducks also did well in the individual running events at the City Championships. Mohri came in fourth in the 3000 meter run with an impressive time of 10 minutes and 47.49 seconds, (10:47.49), and Khrimian also came in fourth in the 1500 meter run with a time of four minutes and 58.09 seconds (4:58.09).</p><p>Racewalking has always been a strong event for the Greyducks, and it was no different at the City Championships, where the Greyducks dominated the 1500 meter walk. Juniors Ziqi Guo and Joyce Wu also came in first and second places, respectively, with times of seven minutes and 31.41 seconds (7:31.41) and seven minutes and 35.28 seconds (7:35.28), respectively. Guo will be attending Nationals for a second time. As Dr. Markova said, “Our racewalk is always a strong event and we got as many points as we could.”</p><p>The highlight of the City Championships on May 28, however, was the fact that Stuyvesant’s own senior and co-captain Sharon Hu was honored as the winner of the PSAL 2017 Track & Field Scholar-Athlete Scholarship Award, which honors students’ outstanding achievements in the classroom, in the community and on the field. Hu was nominated by Dr. Markova as an athlete who demonstrated a commitment to excel in these areas. As the winner, Hu received an incredible $2,500 scholarship award for college.</p><p>The Greyducks’ accomplishments are no small feat. Unlike many other sports, most members of them team not only run on the outdoor track team, but also run cross country and indoor track, along with having to juggle the rigors of Stuyvesant with the demands of their daily prce throughout the school year. Even so, the Greyducks have again emerged as a force, and they have much to celebrate. As co-captain Liu aptly said, “With Stuy having such a rigorous curriculum, I have to admit it gets difficult at times balancing a demanding sport like track, where we are in season for the whole year. I am impressed with how far this talented group of girls has come.” Dr. Markova echoed these sentiments, emphasizing that “the captains were very supportive of their teammates,” and that “throughout the whole season, the girls performed really well and were striving for their personal best,” she said. “I am hopeful that the Greyducks will place on the podium in all three seasons [next year].”</p>',

Article.create( title: 'Evan Wong and Nicole Russack - Sophomore Caucus', content: '<p>Though freshmen Evan Wong and Nicole Russack seem to have made a genuine effort to create a platform that is in touch with the concerns of the student body, their ideas are underdeveloped and lack concrete solutions.</p>
<p>For example, the pair proposes a revised cell phone policy. Unlike other tickets, they could name a specific location where students are invited to use their cellphones, explaining that the half floor would be a calm place for students to take a break. </p>
<p>While their proposal to eliminate the need for parents to pick up confiscated phones from the school may be popular with the student body, it is unclear what the duo plans to specifically replace the current cell phone return policy with.</p>
<p>The pair also plans to organize more bake sales in an effort to relieve student anxiety and draw in money for the Student Union (SU). However, they do not acknowledge the Department of Education (DOE) rules that make organizing bake sales difficult. This lack of knowledge about basic DOE rules indicates that these candidates did not research the plausibility of their platform.</p>
<p>Their platform also demonstrates a lack of awareness with issues that former caucuses and the SU have attempted to resolve. Evan and Nicole’s platform promises to reinforce the homework policy, though they have no clear plan for implementation. They recognize that there are flaws in the way that this problem is being addressed by the SU, but do not propose a solution.</p>
<p>In addition, they are unaware of past SU efforts to let students come in early during lunch and could not articulate what they would do differently than former caucus presidents who failed to achieve this goal. </p>
<p>During The Spectator’s interview with this ticket, the two seemed disjointed in their policy plans, with the two candidates often expressing different ideas and having to clarify with one another what their actual plan is. Russack seemed more knowledgeable about their platform than her running mate, which created an unsettling dynamic, since she is running for vice president. While discussing their physical education uniform policy, for instance, Wong asserted that students would not need to change. Russack interjected, saying they wanted to do away with uniforms, but still force students to change, and then apologized on Wong’s behalf. </p>
<p>While The Spectator appreciates Wong and Russack’s awareness of the student body’s desires, their platform is missing the thought-out plans that caucus candidates need in order to achieve real change and does not warrant an endorsement.</p>

Article.create( title: 'Changes On the Horizon for the Big Sib Program: Good or Bad?', content: '<p>“We have for years referred to them as mini-counselors. They are the ones getting to see the freshmen and the transfer sophomore students the most in the beginning, and are the most tuned-in to how they are doing in their transition,” Assistant Principal of Guidance Casey Pedrick said.</p>
<p>Even so, the guidance office has decided to play a larger role in Stuyvesant’s Big Sib program in the hope of improving its organization and effectiveness. In the past, the Big Sib program was completely student-run, from the application process and selection to homeroom management and Big Sib accountability. </p>
<p>Applications were not standardized and were based heavily on the Big Sib Chairs’ personal judgments, while attendance records were rarely kept for homerooms. As a result, the program seemed to be more oriented toward the privilege of being a Big Sib, rather than offering support systems to incoming students.</p>
<p>Of the Little Sibs surveyed, 48.9 percent reported knowing all of their Big Sibs’ names. This is certainly a mark of success, but it also means a slight majority of Little Sibs did not know their Big Sibs’ names. Five upperclassmen are entrusted with the responsibility to mentor 30 freshmen through Stuyvesant, and it does not require a large impression to be made in order to remember so few names. What it does require is initiative on the part of Big Sibs to introduce themselves and make legitimate connections.</p>
<p>At its core, these problems stem from an issue with the highly subjective selection of Big Sibs. “There are some people who either should not be Big Sibs or just don’t do their jobs as Big Sibs,” Big Sib Chair Kevin Li said. Also surrounding the program is the stigma of nepotism.</p>
<p>To alleviate these problems, the guidance office has revamped the selection process by adding an anonymous first stage with a rubric. “In the beginning, [the Big Sib Chairs] are giving points to things in different areas [based on] the rubric. None of that was ever done before. It was just them reviewing it on paper, taking their little notes, having the interviews. At least now you have an anonymous review with a rubric you are following,” Pedrick said.</p>
<p>A concern with a rubric-based application, however, is that it focuses too much on academic performance. It is important to have students with a variety of perspectives and achievement levels in the program. <p>
In some instances, the rubric appears to be almost an afterthought—interviews, for instance, began before an interview rubric was finalized. This system was created in order to provide students with a concrete idea of why they may not have been accepted into the program, yet it should not exist simply to cover that base.
<p>It is important to strike a balance between transparency and avoiding robotic selections. One important step that has been taken is lowering the grade requirement for Big Sib applicants from an 88 to an 85 and being more strict about maintaining this baseline; the new cut-off will allow more students to be eligible while also standardizing the process.</p>
<p>Many upperclassmen, once selected for the program, also find that there is no incentive to be an active participant; even with homeroom leaders, some freshmen homerooms are devoid of Big Sibs. “We’ll hear from teachers that no Big Sibs came to homeroom today or only three come consistently,” Pedrick said.</p>
<p>Under the restructured program, Big Sib Chairs will no longer be assigned to a specific homeroom. Instead, they will each oversee a batch of homerooms and provide direct guidance to homeroom leaders. Additionally, homeroom teachers may be asked to report any Big Sib absences to the guidance office. </p>
<p>Both the guidance office and the Big Sib Chairs recognize that Little Sibs often face issues that are beyond the scope of another student. In these instances it is important that the Big Sibs have a close connection with their Little Sibs’ guidance counselors so that they can pass on any larger issues. To promote this, most Little Sib homerooms will have at least one Big Sib who shares their guidance counselor.</p>
<p>To ensure that freshmen foster a relationship with their guidance counselor, instead of giving a generic introduction to their entire homeroom during Camp Stuy, counselors will hold smaller meetings in the hallway. “We want the guidance counselors to not only […] go to each homeroom and talk [at Camp Stuy,] but to talk to specific kids in homeroom. For example, pull out two or three [students] at a time to really introduce themselves and make themselves approachable,” Li said.</p>
<p>Camp Stuy, along with the Big Sib Little Sib Dance, is part of the frenzy of activity that the Big Sib Program opens up with each year. But by the end of the first marking period, apathy seeps into the program. To combat this, the new Big Sib Chairs are planning to hold events outside of school throughout the year.</p>
<p>“Homeroom is only once every two weeks generally for 15 minutes. We’re going to try to maximize the opportunities we have face to face with our Little Sibs. I know some homerooms [already] have little bubble tea meetups and things like that. [Now,] not only one homeroom is doing it, but all homerooms are doing it,” Big Sib Chair Charlotte Ruhl said.</p>
<p>However, a more effective way for Big Sibs and Little Sibs to bond would be through weekly, rather than sporadic, homerooms, which both would be required to attend. Homerooms should not only be a time to hand out forms, but a place for students to interact. In the past, Big Sib Chairs have spoken with faculty about having more frequent homerooms, but they have not been cooperative in helping underclassmen assimilate.</p>
<p>The guidance office’s involvement in restructuring the program has obvious benefits, but historically the Big Sib program has been entirely student-run. This autonomy is part of what makes Stuyvesant a unique school, and student-based leadership makes Big Sibs truly welcoming and inspiring. We hope the Big Sib Chairs continue to be the driving force behind the program.</p>

Article.create( title: 'An Open Letter to Stuyvesant', content: '<p>Dear Stuyvesant,</p>
 <p>I don’t think I’ve ever told you this, but I love you. From walking through the bridge entrance on that very first day (after getting yelled at and kicked out by the security guards at the main entrance), to smiling through my tears as teachers assign my fifth project of the week, I have increasingly fallen in love with your broken escalators and unintelligible morning announcements.</p>
<p>Every day, you continue to shape me into a better person. I’ve become more dexterous as I delicately practice balancing a large hazelnut iced coffee from McDonald’s between my chemistry lab report and AP Euro review book. I’ve become more fit as I run up the broken seven-to-nine escalators, dodging the rolling backpacks and PDA. I’ve learned how to hold my breath as I go to my locker on the fourth floor near the West staircase so that Señor Simon doesn’t come out and impale me with a copy of Descubre 2.</p>
<p>You really play hard to get sometimes, but I’ve come to realize that it’s just a part of your charm. I was ecstatic to get within viewing distance of Ms. Fong’s head at program changes, even if I got turned away after waiting for two hours. I’m absolutely smitten at the fact that we have such sturdy benches, although we’re not allowed to sit on them during normal school hours. And knowing that we have a library, even if I can’t get in because I arrived roughly two seconds after the end bell, gives me a warm feeling inside.</p>
<p>So the next time I squeeze out of the subway, sandwiched in a car full of stressed, half-asleep students trying not to drop their physics study guides as they nod off, I’ll be thinking of you, Stuy. Just know that in four years, I’ll be calling you.</p>
<p>Xoxo,</p>
<p>Jane</p>

Article.create( title: 'Statistically Insignificant', content: '<p> Stuy is a numbers game. We’re 3300 of the million high school students in the city. We all took a test, got an ID number, and go about our 10-floor, 300-classroom school every day thinking about the tests and homework that constrain our academic lives. We’re 74 percent Asian, 20 percent white, 3 percent Latino, and 1 percent black.</p>
<p> We all know this, but for some perspective, here are some comparisons from the Class of 2016: there were six times as many students that only came to school 90 percent of the time than there were black students, and there were more students in the Class of 2016 who never passed their Physics Regents than there were black students. Currently, there are barely enough black students to fill a single classroom, and that has been true for the entirety of my time at Stuy.</p>
<p>As a black kid, my experiences over the past three years regarding race at Stuy haven’t been great. In freshman year, it started with the classics like, “Hey, aren’t you supposed to be good at basketball?” and “Who’s your favorite rapper?” to which my respective answers are “No,” and “Probably Kanye, he’s a genius.” These jokes are certainly a little off-color, but the really annoying part is that they’re constant and not very good. </p>
<p> If you’ve just met me and want to make a joke, please come up with something less casually racist and more original than those mentioned above. We’re all smart kids; just put in a little more effort for a first impression.</p>
<p> As I got older, however, it became harder and harder to brush off these comments. I started having more and more serious conversations around the dinner table about proper etiquette when with police and how to dress and where not to run after the sun went down. My parents were laying down these rules not just because I was getting older, but because of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown and Eric Garner and Tamir Rice. The resounding message was that it didn’t matter whether you were right or wrong, because if you weren’t twice as careful as everyone else, you might be dead.</p>
<p>So, when I got to school and heard, on multiple occasions, kids laughing in the hallways or bathroom about saying “Nigger-ia” instead of Nigeria, or when I was called “black enough to get into college but not black enough to get shot by the cops,” it became harder and harder to just brush it off. These are some of the worst examples, but slightly racist offhand comments are frequent and constant in my time at Stuy. But they aren’t the things that bother me most.</p>
<p> What truly worries me about Stuy is the widespread tendency to use statistics and big data and impersonal measurements to back up racist comments. If I’m having a semi-serious discussion about race in the halls or on the bridge or in class, laying out how my own personal thoughts and experiences have shaped my opinion, one of the most common responses I’ve gotten is “[insert racist comment here], just look at the data: [insert probably true but not helpful and very vague statistics here].” In discussions about affirmative action, it’s usually, “Black people aren’t as smart, just look at the data. They have low average SAT scores.” In discussions about police brutality, it’s usually, “Black people are more likely to be criminals, just look at the data. There is a disproportionate number of black people in jail.”</p>
<p>As The Spectator found in their freshman surveys, there simply aren’t enough minority students for it to be “statistically significant” data, or for the statistics collected on a national level to be more valid when applied to Stuyvesant than an individual’s anecdote. Statistics offer an enticingly easy way to justify not thinking that hard about other people’s experiences, and they provide an easy but faulty alternative than simply having a conversation.</p>
<p>What I would encourage everyone to do is take a moment, slow down, and think about the words that are about to come out of your mouth. I am in no way advocating for policing your speech, but I would like to see a little more thought go into the things we say and do at Stuy and in the wider world. It isn’t about being politically correct; it’s about showing some thought and respect for the feelings of others. Because, no matter how you justify it or how much you think it’s a joke, racist generalizations or stereotyping or prejudice can at best be an annoying joke to put up with, and at worst a constant reminder that racism is still alive and well, even at a place like Stuyvesant. </p>
<p> Perhaps if we put as much effort into thinking about what we say as we put into studying for biology tests, we could make Stuy a more welcoming place for everyone.</p>',

Article.create( title: 'College Essay: Eli Sandine', content: '<p>I am not sure why, in seventh grade, I chose to play the tuba. Perhaps it was due to a lack of confidence in spelling the words “Alto Saxophone” or “Piccolo.” Or maybe it was like my decision to study Mandarin over Spanish and I wanted to challenge myself. More likely, I was trying to compensate for being the second shortest boy in my class. Regardless of the reason, after a year of practicing every other day and smiling politely whenever I was asked if I could fit in the case, I found myself at the end-of-year concert sitting on two reams of colorful printer paper so that I could reach the mouthpiece. I played with pride.</p>
<p>For the remainder of my time at middle school, I was the best (and only) tubist in the school. On the first day at my high school of thirty-two hundred students, however, I became one of six tuba players in my band alone. Luckily for me, I found that playing the tuba was more than being the best, especially in December. The beginning of winter is exciting for the band when we switch from Bach and Sousa to upbeat, nostalgic holiday music. Furthermore, while tubas are often overlooked in compositions, our school’s annual selection features several tuba pieces. The holiday concert begins each year with the tubas playing “You’re a Mean One, Mister Grinch” as our conductor approaches the podium.</p>
<p>Another tuba tradition is rehearsing “Hark the Herald Tubas Sing,” wherein the tubas play the melody. The first time we attempted it, the other tuba players dropped out quickly. I, however, had planned ahead and rehearsed the piece on my own time, so I knew the solo perfectly. I played on. I was thrilled to have all eyes on me, until the second-chair tubist whispered, “It’s all you, Ely.” This revelation, combined with the absurdity of the piece, led me to laugh uncontrollably. The piece soon fell apart as the sound of amplified laughter through a tuba was too funny for the other one hundred twenty musicians. Less than a minute later, the band was back on track. At that moment I realized that no matter how much work and pride I put into something, I will always be able to laugh at myself.</p>
<p>The more I play, the more I appreciate the lessons of the instrument beyond how to read music and which buttons to press. Rehearsing the same piece over and over again, whether it be Raider’s March or The Crown Imperial, has taught me the value of tenacity and patience. Furthermore, tubas are often neglected by composers, and the base line is often not as fast or flashy as the melodies. Despite this, the tubas, along with the percussionists, are charged with controlling the tempo of the piece. Leadership through collaboration, along with taking on behind-the-scenes responsibilities, are among my defining traits. These traits surface when I complete paperwork as captain of my school’s Ultimate Frisbee team, debug a group computer science project, or carry leaky water bottles to make sure eight-year-old campers don’t get dehydrated on a hot summer day.</p>
<p>Now, when I tell people that I play the tuba, they no longer ask if I can fit in the case, but they do tend to smile. I am still not sure why I chose to play the tuba, but my intuition has served me well. Playing the tuba has never been all I am, but it is part of who I am: A person who seeks the biggest challenge, a person who works hard in everything he does, and a person who does not take himself too seriously.</p>',

Article.create(title: 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Add-On', content: '<p>“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” takes place 19 years after the events of the original seven books, but still grips the reader with the same thrill and excitement.</p>
<p>This two-part stage play was written by Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, with surprisingly minimal input from the original author of the franchise, J.K. Rowling. The play first premiered on July 30, and its rehearsal script was released a day later. </p>
<p>In “Cursed Child,” the reader gets to focus on Albus Potter, Harry’s son, and his struggle with facing an unwanted legacy, but it also manages to give adequate attention to the past.</p>
<p>“Cursed Child” has already done very well, selling two million copies in two days. And the reason is clear: it’s extremely well written. To start off, it takes the universe that was already set up by Rowling and uses it to further develop the characters and their relationships between family and friends.</p>
<p>Let’s look to our title character. Fans know plenty about Harry Potter. They’ve practically grown up learning of his rebellious nature and unwavering loyalty. They know him as a student, a friend, and a hero. But they don’t know him as a father.</p>
<p>Thorne kept Harry consistent as a character. Harry’s willingness to do anything to save the son who wants nothing to do with him and standing up to friends and enemies alike, reminds the reader of his loyalty and gives a new paternal side to him.</p>
<p>Thorne also does a good job introducing new characters. Albus, the protagonist, could’ve easily come off as bratty and unlikable, with a seemingly irrational hatred of his own father, but we’re able to see his inherited fierce loyalty through his friendship with Scorpius and his desire to escape from not his father, but his father’s legacy.</p>
<p>Scorpius Malfoy, son of Harry’s enemy Draco Malfoy, gives something unique the story. He has a certain naiveté to him that’s never really been seen in a Harry Potter book. Unlike how Draco was set up to be someone to hate in the first seven books, Scorpius is the complete opposite—very sweet and likeable—especially as Albus’ only true friend.</p>
<p>The play focuses less on the magical aspect of Harry Potter, which was something that would have left readers in awe and wonder. But, by focusing more on familial relationships and friendships, the play is able to connect to the reader on a much deeper level.</p>
<p>As good as the play is, we also have to ask: is it too much of a good thing?</p>
<p>It’s been 19 years since the publication of the first book of the series and about nine years since the last book was published. There are franchises that have gone on longer, but many believed the Harry Potter series was concluded with the seventh book published in 2007. As a result, the sudden announcement of a new addition was surprising, but not necessarily in a good way.</p>
<p>There have already been spin-off books and stories, many of which can be found on the Pottermore website, and it has even been confirmed that a spin-off movie called “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” is in the works.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly what they are—spin-offs. “Cursed Child,” despite the significance it aims to hold, is just a spin-off, and thus can’t gather as big of an audience as its predecessors. </p>
<p>After the creation of so many spin-offs, it could be valid to say J.K. Rowling should’ve left her fictional universe be. Seeing that the original series consists of seven books and eight movies, all the spin-offs that came afterwards serve no true purpose besides utilizing the series’ fame to sell more, especially since Rowling has no other plans to actually continue the series itself.</p>
<p>The unnecessary continuation of a good series can lead to its downfall. “Cursed Child,” however good it may be, can and will always be viewed as just another spin-off and not a work truly comparable to the originals. What’s worse is that if “Cursed Child” wasn’t as good as it turned out to be, the entire franchise could have been affected.</p>
<p>If I could say anything to Rowling on this matter, I’d say: Create whatever you want to create. No one has the right to stop you, but be careful; if your future works are even the tiniest bit lackluster, there are great implications concerning the success of the whole franchise.</p>

Article.create( title: 'A Stuy Student’s Guide to Springtime Flicks', content: '<p>As the youngest child in my family, I’ve never had a problem with getting attention from my parents. My older sisters, though? Not so much. They most likely detested my presence as much as Timothy Templeton detested his brother, Boss Baby, in “The Boss Baby.”</p>
<p>“The Boss Baby” follows the story of a young boy named Tim (voiced by Tobey Maguire), whose perfect life as an only child shatters when he is introduced to his new baby brother, an undercover, arrogant, businessman-like infant called Boss Baby (voiced by Alec Baldwin). In a hilarious twist of fate, the two have to put aside their differences and work together to stop the villainous corporation Puppy Co., or else Boss Baby will lose his job and be forced to stay with Tim’s family forever. However, on the way, the two end up bonding much more than they had expected.</p>
<p>“The Boss Baby” is an animated comedy produced by Dreamworks Animation, directed by Tom McGrath and written by Michael McCullers. It was inspired by the picture book of the same name, which was written and illustrated by Marla Frazee.</p>
<p>The film begins with a very inventive premise—babies are mass-produced in the heavens rather than born and are divided into two groups: those who will be sent to families and live normal lives and those who are too adult-like and will be sent to work at Baby Corp., a company whose goal is to make sure babies stay loved forever. Boss Baby, who is part of the latter, is sent to Tim’s family, tasked with the mission of infiltrating Puppy Co. and finding information on its plan to release a secret puppy that will replace babies in the public’s hearts.</p>
<p>However, “The Boss Baby” disappoints viewers due to this uninspired plot line. The antagonist’s goal of making puppies more beloved than babies and reasoning for doing so feels very uncreative and brainless, and so much more could have been done with it given the imaginative setting the film sets up. Overall, the film seems to drag on the plot for longer than necessary with somewhat repetitive “Tom and Jerry”-like chase scenes.</p>
<p>The film manages to keep the audience captivated, though, with humorous lines and scenarios, such as the brothers’ parents walking in on the two sucking on Boss Baby’s pacifiers and slowly walking back out. The gruff Alec Baldwin’s (who coincidentally plays Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live”) portrayal of a baby is satisfying to hear, as he cracks some jokes and references more suited towards older audiences, like the line “Put that cookie down! Cookies are for closers!” alluding to one of his prior movies, “Glengarry Glen Ross.” </p>
<p>In addition, the constant juxtaposition of Tim’s imaginative, action-packed view against the duller reality is very clever, typically utilizing a 2D, cartoon-like visual for Tim’s dramatized mind, such as a scene using silhouettes where a ninja-like Tim sneaks through a hallway. It’s especially amusing to see the film shift from Tim clinging on to a dangerously fast police car for life to his parents watching him be sluggishly dragged by the Boss Baby’s toy ride, face-planted into the ground.</p>
<p>Though “The Boss Baby” is lacking in plot, it makes up for it in its budding relationship between Tim and Boss Baby. The two gradually shift from mortal enemies vying for their parents’ attention to brothers who truly care for each other, as they are forced by their parents to spend more time with one another. It’s sweet to watch the two brothers being forced to dress up in sailor costumes for pictures and playing as pirates together. Possibly one of the most touching moments in the film is when Tim sings Boss Baby the song his parents always sang to him, “Blackbird,” in order to bring him down. Tim sends Boss Baby a letter allowing him to stay with him and thousands of his small colorful toys, representing their love.</p>
<p>This brotherly love is what makes “The Boss Baby” so memorable, as the two brothers’ few heart-to-hearts feel truly genuine and personal. Perhaps we all could learn a thing or two about dealing with our siblings from Tim and Boss Baby.</p>

Article.create( title: 'Five-Minute Trends', content: '<p>Oh, New York, filled with the stench of success and $1.00 pizza. Evolution in the city that never sleeps means constantly innovating and experimenting with the art of food. Cookie dough, once relegated to the bottom of the freezer and the occasional baking expenditure, has now become the basis for a classy, hot pink cafe in Greenwich Village. Cake appears on towering waffle stacks in a perfect defiance of a healthy breakfast. Bagels are dyed in funky colors, a reflection of the hippie 1960s and of our overwhelming need to be unicorns. Here are some of the desserts New York famously offers</p>
<p>Prize for most original and glorious creation since Michelangelo’s David goes to Clinton Hall’s Red Velvet WTF Waffles. For $15, you can enjoy the layered version of the junk food aisle in Clinton Hall, a spacious Battery Park restaurant. The Red Velvet Waffle is really three individual red velvet waffles stacked on top of each other with layers of ice cream, raspberry sauce, oreos, whipped cream, and more stuff in between. A slice of red velvet cake delicately perches at the top of the confection. Towering, incredibly rich, and dripping with gooey wonder, Red Velvet WTF Waffles are worth the hype and will surely leave your taste buds shook.</p>
<p>Found on just about all of Instagram, rainbow bagels are the food equivalent of a Lisa Frank sticker set. Strongly resembling colorful play-doh rolled together, rainbows bagels are overly sweet, vaguely fruit-loopy, and offered with a variety of whimsical cream cheese fillings—from funfetti to Fruity Pebbles. Though created by The Bagel Store over 15 years ago, they’ve blown up fairly recently, praised for the experience and photo opportunity they provide more than the taste. You can get them at 754 Metropolitan Avenue in Brooklyn, for only the cost of a long wait and about $7.00 per bagel. Or perhaps skip the train ride and go to Zucker’s instead. </p>
<p>News alert: your favorite, but possibly dangerous, mid-baking snack has been turned into a  safe-to-eat dessert that can be be consumed shamelessly. Cookie Do NYC, a cheerful, Pinterest- worthy bakery found at 550 LaGuardia Place, is an homage to cookie dough in all its forms—in scoops, waffle cones, ice-cream sandwich, baked cookies and cupcakes, as pie filling, sundaes and more. Scooped cookie dough ($4 for a single scoop) is offered in 13 classic cookie flavors, ranging from commando (plain) to brownie batter to peanut butter snickerdoodle. With Cookie Do NYC regularly opening to long lines that wrap around the block, cookie dough is clearly in high demand. Driving its appeal is the innovation of a classic dessert that brings back nostalgic childhood memories and a sweet, smooth flavor. The verdict: drop in, but in the case of a mile-long line, hit up your local supermarket instead. </p>
<p>Eat away your computer science grade with the unexpectedly perfect combination of greasy goodness in the form of deep fried oreo pizza. Created in a relaxed, retro-style Krave It in Bayside, Queens, batter-covered oreos are deep fried to golden perfection, baked on top of a cheese pizza, and generously topped with powdered sugar and oreo crumbs. The perfect mix of textures—crunchy, sweet oreos combined with gooey cheese—makes the pizza ($16 per pie) pass as both a guilty pleasure dessert and a hearty meal. Not as popular as it should be, deep fried oreo pizza is the quintessential New York food.</p>

Article.create( title: 'Senior SING!: Fairy Tales are Women’s Tales', content: '<p>Fairy tales are women’s tales: Sleeping Beauty rescued by the gallant Prince Charming, Snow White’s maternal impulse toward the dwarves, and Cinderella forced to scrub the floors. These stories used to put us to bed at night, teaching young girls that they should strive to become objects of male attention and teaching young boys that every girl is an unambitious damsel in distress.</p>
<p>With Princess Esme’s (Lizzy Lawrence) strong-willed temperament and Prince Chauncey’s (Michael Holmes) ineptitude, Senior SING!, coordinated by Winston Venderbush with the help of producers Vicky Wu, Maddie Ostergaard, Namra Zulfiqar, and Dina Gomaa, was medieval with a twist, weaving an entirely new women’s tale.</p>
<p>The audience is immediately made aware of Esme’s predicament: her first queue to speak is cut off by King Bartholomew (Dennis Ronel), her father, whose focus is entirely on Chauncey’s coronation. Continuously silenced and overshadowed, Esme is disgruntled with Chauncey’s nonchalance toward the throne, yet she remains anything but demure or helpless.</p>
<p>It may not have been a girl sitting in a tower, singing to the birds, but Senior SING! opened up with visions of our childhood. Within a castle on a hill, stained glass reflected light onto golden thrones. With a stunning background and eagle statues, senior art, directed by Yuji Fu, Lauren Moy, Jasmine Zhang, and Miranda Luong, and senior props, directed by Sydney Dlhopolsky, made us feel like we were in the Kingdom of Wessex.</p>
<p>The coronation festivities began with a hymn-like rendition of “Some Nights,” as chorus, step, and cast gathered on stage, the sheer number of performers inspiring awe.</p>
<p>Amidst this flurry of celebration, senior latin, directed by Levy Agaronnik and Joshua Lishnevetsky, sensually materialized before the crowd, hips thrusting and bodies swaying. Their liveliness was pronounced and every movement emboldened with character, making them our favorite crew of the night.</p>
<p>Following King Bartholomew’s resounding “no” to Esme’s attempt to speak, Yorick the jack-in-the-box (Alec Dai) is brought forth as comedic relief. Taking a drink from Chauncey’s goblet, he collapses back into the box—poisoned.</p>
<p>“Clear the Senior Atrium!” is shouted across the stage, a reference to antagonisms between the senior class and administration, connecting the otherwise distant theme to Stuyvesant students. From the ensuing stampede emerges senior step, the castle guards, directed by Jason Chen, Samuel So, and Kelly Wang. Between their reverence for senior pride and the reverberations created by each stomp, their unity was on full display. Holding their S-E-N-I-O-R shields high, they ended with a blindingly fast sequence.</p>
<p>Once again, Esme’s tensions rise to the surface when King Bartholomew focuses his attention entirely on Chauncey. Reminding us of her misplaced anger, Esme remarked condescendingly, “Who would want to kill Chauncey?” This continuous use of foreshadowing gives the script a complexity not seen in years past, creating anticipation amongst the audience for a breaking point in their relationship.</p>
<p>In an attempt to protect Chauncey, the king calls on the services of Sir Komsyze (Evan Lieberman), a Monty Python-esque knight and sorceress Helloise (Emily Ma), Chauncey’s budding love interest. Far from being stoic bodyguards, this pair lead the siblings on an adventure to find a safe haven, but instead they come across a plague-infested village.</p>
<p>In the face of this suffering, Esme emphasized that a leader must shoulder the burden of his or her people. Meanwhile, Chauncey cowered at the people’s pain, shattering the traditional association between masculinity and strength or conviction.</p>
<p>The atmosphere darkened, the air became murky, and the black plague encircled Chauncey. Senior modern, directed by Nadia Filanovsky and Enver Ramadani, began their performance with a haunting execution of “Ring Around the Rosie.” Wilting flower petals fell to the floor as the dancers sought to embody the plague with each eery, coordinated step.</p>
<p>Donning black silk and green velvet, the powerful figure of Helloise stepped in to save Chauncey, who was overwhelmed by the reality of his subjects’ living conditions. Even supporting female roles, traditionally lacking depth, were able to manifest themselves into positive role models.</p>
<p>The next obstacle the travellers overcame was a snake pit: senior belly, directed by Shupti Biswas and Sabrina Pirzada. A mix of jazz and blues highlighted their sensuous, undulating torsos, only a small sample of the senior band’s talent, directed by Jean Joun and Sam Lazarev. Somewhat incongruous with last year’s performance, belly lacked male participation.</p>
<p>When a third obstacle appears, the path to safety threatens to become repetitive and tedious, but senior hip hop, directed by Jian Ting, Muhammad Rivaldo, Nina Uzoigwe, and Tony Zheng, managed to further engage the audience. Dressed as bandits in black, holding knives, and dancing fluidly, performers popped up in the aisles to create an electrifying moment.</p>
<p>Almost randomly, a dragon then appears in their path. With its four members, senior flow, directed by Wilson Wong and Ayman Ahmed, seemed to lack purpose. Last year, senior flow set the precedent of being much more than floating lights; this year, flow failed to innovate, and unlike the other crews, seemed to be carelessly thrown into the story.</p>
<p>Completely in character, Chauncey fails to protect himself, and his carelessness pushes Esme to her breaking point; she proclaims it would have been better if he had died.</p>
<p>Back at the castle, the Royal Family has troubles of its own. After interrogating several quirky characters, Esme becomes their prime suspect when her best friend Priscilla Marie (Lillian Carver) testifies against her. Marie is represented as a gossiping gold digger, and was executed brilliantly. Her nasally voice and frantic body motions lent themselves perfectly to the stereotype.</p>
<p>Making her first appearance as a developed character, Queen Christiana (Kate Johnston), shocked by this information, performs a heartbreaking medley of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” with the overlapping voice of Esme singing “Back to Black” as she confronts her hateful words toward her brother. Though Junior SING! attempted a similar feat, they were unable to achieve this level of cohesion.</p>
<p>Finally, our protagonists reached two forks in the road, and we appreciated the pun. Here, Sir Komsyze and Helloise each took different routes, leaving Esme and Chauncey to confront their culminating tensions.</p>
<p>Esme vented her frustrations: while Chauncey spent his childhood learning to joust, she was taught to dress pretty. The intent of her speech was to have the audience acknowledge how gender roles can be discouraging forces, transforming SING! from a celebration of creativity to a platform for student voices.</p>
<p>Through a duet of “Halo,” Chauncey and Esme are able to reconcile. As the lights and sound crew, directed by Jonathan Mikhaylov and Lela Ni, placed a simple spotlight on Chauncey and Esme, the audience showed their support with flashlights. Chauncey’s timbre was warm and rich and complemented Esme’s sweeter tones.</p>
<p>This tender moment is interrupted by a surprising plot twist. Overlooked for the majority of the play, Sir Komsyze stabs Chauncey and reveals that he has successfully framed Esme for this murder. Esme takes a stand by picking up Chauncey’s blade and fighting the trained knight, showing her courage and compassion.</p>
<p>All night Senior SING! had tip-toed around the fourth wall, and they finally breached it: Lawrence and Lieberman break character and call for stunt doubles. A dramatic fight scene ensues, and Esme emerges victorious. However, her success is short-lived; she is captured and taken to the castle for her execution.</p>
<p>Confronted with seemingly concrete evidence that his daughter killed his son, King Bartholomew grieves for both of his children through his moving performance of “Hallelujah.” When Esme attempts to explain the situation, she once again is silenced.</p>
<p>In the final minutes before her execution, Chauncey and Heloise miraculously arrive at the scene and reveal Sir Komsyze’s treachery. Chauncey comes to the realization that Esme understands and cares about the well-being of the kingdom more than he does. He forfeits his crown to Esme, showing the importance of humility and reversing the stereotype of men being best suited for leadership positions; her coronation is a feminist triumph.</p>
<p>The coronation festivities were born anew, and senior swing, directed by Levy Agaronnik and Joshua Lishnevetsky, excelled just as much as senior latin. Senior SING! seemed to make deliberate decisions that shaped their show, not only as a progressive, but also as a well-crafted story. In an almost cyclical manner, Esme and Chauncey’s long journey begins and ends with the passing of the crown.</p>
<p>Likewise, Senior SING! was able to incorporate pop culture references that modernized what would have been an archaic fairy tale. Though he was a recurring comedic relief, High Priest (Lowell Weisbord), with his rapping, dancing, and pop culture references, proved to be one of the highlights of the show.</p>
<p>By the end of the show, Senior SING! solidified the idea that fairy tales are women’s tales. These are the stories our children will grow up hearing: Michelle Obama, Angela Merkel, Sonia Sotamayor, and Queen Esme.</p>

Article.create( title: "The Composition of a Genius", content: '<p>To be truly intellectually superior, must one sacrifice sentiment? For three seasons of Sherlock, I thought so. Sherlock (BBC) is a modern take on the classic story by Sir Conan Doyle, one of the many to be produced in recent times. However, this show seems to simply grasp the attention of viewers more than its contemporaries—why?</p>
<p>For a while, I believed that the show’s beauty was the masterful portrait painted by Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Sherlock Holmes, of a remarkably intelligent and observant individual incapable of relating to human emotion.</p>
<p>However, in season four of Sherlock, released within the first three weeks of 2017, I feel that the most important development was that of the characters, particularly Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch), Watson (Martin Freeman), and Mycroft (Mark Gatiss).</p>
<p>Mycroft, Sherlock’s older brother, has always been a suspicious character. He is a cameo in many episodes of the series, appearing when Sherlock needs his power as a government official or when he needs Sherlock’s sleuthing abilities. </p>
<p>This workplace dependency is indicative of the very strange relationship between the two brothers. Both are incredibly intelligent and find difficulty relating to society, though Mycroft functions better in it than Sherlock. Their difficulty in relating to society extends to their personal relationship, and the lack of traditional sentiment can often cause friction, particularly when Mycroft keeps information from Sherlock with good intentions, as displayed in episode three of the season.</p>
<p>In season four, this characterization extends and develops into that of a villain. Mycroft’s desire to control everything around him and withhold information bites back when he hurts someone deeply and proves that power has its limits.</p>
<p>Watson’s character development in season four was definitely one of the most surprising. When you picture John Watson over the seasons, you think of a seasoned war hero, a doctor, a loving family man, and a faithful companion to Sherlock. He is the ideal character and provides a contrast to Sherlock’s unpredictable nature. Thus you can imagine my shock at the humanization of Watson in season four as he shows that he is capable of making mistakes and feeling sorrow.</p>
<p>If you did not appreciate Sherlock (the character) before, you definitely will now. The precedent for the character is a complex and unstable genius incapable of understanding society emotionally. In season four, we see that rock overturned as Sherlock goes to extremes to protect those who matter the most to him.</p>
<p>In the first episode of the season we see him travel across the world to tell Mary, Watson’s wife, that he intended to keep his promise of keeping John and his family safe. How well he was able to keep this promise, however, is arguable. </p>
<p>The second episode of the season is more of a shaker, nothing short of what can be expected from the show. It plays on the relationship between John Watson and Sherlock, in a way quite similar to the course followed after Sherlock fakes his own death in a previous season. Watson experiences a rough recovery after the events at the end of the first episode (which the law of spoilers does not allow me to reveal) and inevitably projects his grief onto Sherlock.</p>
<p>It appears that the relationship between the two had evolved into something greater over the past four seasons. What began as a professional relationship and an odd duo grew into a friendship, a particularly significant development considering Sherlock’s sociopathic nature, and this season highlights how Watson has become Sherlock’s responsibility as much as he is Watson’s.</p>
<p>In episode three, we are introduced to a new character, one who seemingly completes the Holmes family. He/She does not necessarily represent much as an individual character, but rather contributes to the development of the other characters.</p>
<p>For Sherlock, the new character presents a puzzle, an enigma. He is put in a situation he has never had to deal with before, and due to his emotional development throughout the show, we watch him empathize for the first time and be able to love and care for someone who hasn’t torn down his walls.</p>
<p>This season, marking the coming-of-age of all the characters, would be perfect to end the show with. Sherlock has become a human, Watson is no longer perfect, and Mycroft is self-actualized. If the series continues any longer, there is a risk that it might become repetitive or seem stretched out. While there is nothing I would like more than more of the witty banter between Sherlock and Watson, this could be the end of an era.</p>
